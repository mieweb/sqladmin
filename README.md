sqladmin
========
SQL Query Tool

sqladmin is a simple SQL shell (with GNU readline capabilities) and syntax highlighting. The goal of this tool is to replace the mysql CLI... but on steroids.

Features
--------
* Syntax highlighting of SQL
* Shared history (even realtime between multiple browser windows, thanks to meteor)
* readline-like shortcuts
  * Hold Alt (mac: Cmd) and:
    * Up - previous entry in the history.
    * Down - next entry in the history.
    * Enter - submit the query.
* Ability to save and share results.

Install
-------
 
* Download: 

        git clone https://github.com/mieweb/sqladmin.git
        cd sqladmin
        ./setup.sh

setup.sh will download meteor if it's not already, and then download the packages needed.

* Run:

        meteor

* browse to the address displayed, and then type in:

        show tables

 * then press Alt (or Cmd) Enter)

Prerequisites
-------------
A MySQL server is required to be reachable from the machine you are hosting the meteor server.  For testing on Mac, I recommend MariaDB (https://mariadb.com/kb/en/building-mariadb-on-mac-os-x-using-homebrew/) or MySQL community server (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).

TODO:
-----
* Allow modification of connection parameters from the front end. (Complete)
  * server side limitations to allow for network security. 
* Display
  * improve the display of results in tabular form (see below).
* Store Results
  * Store results in the mongo collection for easy retrieval.
  * Allow stored results to dump back to mysql.
* Update
  * Rows should support update commands and allow editing results.
  * Option to trigger when updates should be sent to MySQL at the cell, row, or result set.
* Model Map
  * An object that describes all the tables in the db.
  * Built from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA, but indexed for quick look up. (similar to -A on the CLI)
  * Allows labeling of headings.
  * Makes auto-complete possible.
* Foreign Key Intelligence
  * FK relationships should be browse-able from the result table.
  * FK rels should allow for auto-complete on updates.  Model map will help here.
* Stability
  * Better detection when meteor goes
 
TODO improve display:
---------------------
* paginate / infinite scroll
  * Infinite scroll assumes result set does not change server side (i.e.: someone does an insert while scrolling)
* format column headers based on a Model Map
* format cells based on data type (i.e.: dates, numbers, strings)
* if all rows are retrieved, support sorting, filtering, group by on browser
  * The plan is to force a limit, if that limit is not hit, then we know we have the full result set.
  * if not, then don't... but also if it is a simple query, WHERE, ORDER BY and LIMIT could be used server side. 
* Make results graph with d3.
